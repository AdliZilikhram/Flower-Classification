# Flower-Classification
This project involves developing an interactive image classification system 
implemented in Python using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface and scikit-learn 
for machine learning functionalities. The system supports dual-mode classification: 
species classification of Iris flowers using structured CSV data and rose color 
classification from image data. The application allows users to load datasets, 
preprocess inputs, and train Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with linear kernels. 
It includes real-time model performance evaluation using metrics such as precision, 
recall, F1-score, support, and confusion matrix visualization. The system also supports 
prediction tasks via direct user input (for Iris features) or image upload (for rose 
classification), with probability-based confidence bar charts for interpretability. Image 
data is processed using OpenCV for resizing and grayscale feature extraction, and the 
UI dynamically updates to reflect prediction outcomes and training results, offering a 
comprehensive platform for practical experimentation with supervised learning 
workflows.
